<!-- 
  1st - local 
  Web server has a document root.
  Everything thats requested from the server comes from within that root.
  When you are setting something up to prievuew locally. It depends which server ou're using. If webpack server you will be serving files from its document root. Its using express under the cover. That server has my app in its root. My index.js is at the top level.
  
  2nd - deploying
  If deplying to a shared server which has a virtual then Each virtual site has a different document route folder and your app will be put into the document root of your virtual host/server. It will behave like the dev server behaves. / will be the root folder. Again a base url of / will be from that directory.

  Same base url for 1 and 2 will work just fine. 

  3rd - 
  You can use Apache locally instead of the webpack server .
